The main modes of communication are written, verbal, and visual. As a scientist or engineer, you will want to share your work. This is commonly done through thesis, journal papers, and books. This type of writing has a different purpose than creative story telling or other types of writing you may have done. There are rules, standards, and formats which are commonly used. You should know these before you embark on publishing your work.
